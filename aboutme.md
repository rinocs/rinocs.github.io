My name is Riccardo Nocella. I have the following qualities:

- I'm a Computer Engineer with a degree focused on Machine Learning  
- I develop in Python, C++, Go, PHP, HTML, JavaScript (and more!)  
- I have a passion for technology, sports, and outdoor adventures  
- Iâ€™m always learning something new and building cool stuff  

What else do you need?

### My story

I studied at the University of Siena, where I dove deep into Machine Learning and AI â€” it was love at first matrix.  
Now I spend my days crafting software, exploring multiple programming languages, and building everything from smart systems to sleek web apps.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me hitting the gym, snowboarding in the mountains, or fishing by the sea.  
I believe in balance: clean code, strong coffee, and time in nature.

Whether itâ€™s a challenging problem to solve or a fish to catch â€” Iâ€™m all in.  
Letâ€™s build something together, or just talk tech and toss a line in the water.
