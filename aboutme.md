### My story

I studied at the University of Siena, where I dove deep into Machine Learning and AI — it was love at first matrix.  
Now I spend my days crafting software, exploring multiple programming languages, and building everything from smart systems to sleek web apps.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me hitting the gym, snowboarding in the mountains, or fishing by the sea.  
I believe in balance: clean code, strong coffee, and time in nature.

Whether it’s a challenging problem to solve or a fish to catch — I’m all in.  
Let’s build something together, or just talk tech and toss a line in the water.
